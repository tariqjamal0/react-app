        <h1>About</h1>
        <p>Chess is a board game for two players. It is played in a square board, made of 64 smaller squares, with eight squares on each side. Each player starts with sixteen pieces: eight pawns, two knights,
           two bishops, two rooks, one queen and one king. ... The player with white pieces always makes the first move</p>

        <p>Step 1. How To Setup The Chessboard At the beginning of the game the chessboard is laid out
         so that each player has the white (or light) color square in the bottom right-hand side.The chess pieces are then arranged the same way each time. The second row (or rank) is filled with pawns. The rooks go in the corners, 
         then the knights next to them, followed by the bishops, and finally the queen, who always goes on her own
          matching color (white queen on white, black queen on black), and the king on the remaining square.</p>
          <p>Step 2. How The Chess Pieces Move. Each of the 6 different kinds of pieces moves differently. 
            Pieces cannot move through other pieces (though the knight can jump over other pieces), 
            and can never move onto a square with one of their own pieces. However, they can be moved to take the place of an opponent's piece which is then captured. Pieces are generally moved into positions where they can capture other pieces (by landing on their square and then replacing them),
            defend their own pieces in case of capture, or control important squares in the game.</p>
          <p>Step 3. Discover The Special Rules Of Chess
            There are a few special rules in chess that may not seem logical at first. They were created to make the game more fun and interesting.

            How To Promote A Pawn In Chess
            Pawns have another special ability and that is that if a pawn reaches the other side of the board it can become any other chess piece
            (called promotion) excluding a king (or pawn, for that matter).</p>
